- 👋 Hi, I’m @LogosDatum
- 👀 I’m interested in programming as a whole, whether it's development of some kind, or machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, with plans to learn Python and Java down the line
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to develop my skills in the future, still learning
- 📫 You can reach me @LogosDatum pretty much everywhere including gmail
- 🐉︁ I think my first mini-project will be spicing up this readme
